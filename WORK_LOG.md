| Sept 11th | 12:45pm - 1:15pm  |I began brainstorming on how to approach this problem mathematically and realized that I need to make a new hospital on each end of every road that cannot be connected. I think that you have to basically create branches of cities that have roads connecting each city within the group to a hospital. If a city cannot have a road connected to a new city, then that city needs to start a new group of cities. This process needs to be repeated until every city is connected to a hospital. |
| Sept 11th |  1:15pm - 1:45pm  |I talked with Oliver and we figured out that each group of cities will need n-1 bridges. I read through all of the test case code to understand how the problem works and to see some of test cases. In addition, I wrote code for the instance where hospitals costs less than highways, and if so just build a hospital in every city. |
| Sept 14th |  8:00pm - 8:45pm  |I attempted to solve this mathematically via a whiteboard (which wasn't big enough). First, I began by drawing cities randomly and having random gaps between them (like a body of water). In all of my examples the cost of a hospital was always more than the cost of a highway, as I have the situation where the hospitals are cheaper already covered in my code. |
| Sept 14th |  8:45pm - 9:30pm  | Secondly, I connected them in the most efficient way and confirmed that the idea of having groups of cities that had one hospital and roads connecting all of the cities with the group to a hospital would be the cheapest. I then started thinking about this from a computer science angle (ie like how I would code this using the information I just learned and have been given over the past few weeks via the lectures in class). I think that using maps would be helpful to see if cities are connecting (or one's around it are connecting to get the least amount of hospitals). |
| Sept 18th |  2:15pm - 2:45pm  |Mr. Blick helped me go over the quiz question regarding the Union-Find algorithm to help me fully understand it. In addition, he went over path compression and weight balancing with me. It finally clicked for me! For weight balancing, the value at the end of some of the nodes are how many other nodes they are connected to. |
| Sept 19th | 10:25pm - 11:25pm |I wrote code for the path compression part of the project. I had some errors so I used the debugger to try and swift through it. I found that my map was filled with all 0's and that I needed to change the order in which certain variables are set to each other (the nodes and roots). |
| Sept 20th | 10:45pm - 11:30pm |I had more errors and used the debugger to change a couple of equals into not equals. I finished all my code and got my code to pass all of the tests! I added a bunch of comments to make my code clearer. |
| Sept 21st | 10:20pm - 11:00pm |Did my final touches on my code and added my citation at the top of my code (Diego, for helping me debug and explain a couple of ideas/pointers). |
