| Sept 11th | 12:45pm - 1:15pm  |                                                                                         I began brainstorming on how to approach this problem mathematically and realized that I need to make a new hospital on each end of every road that cannot be connected. I think that you have to basically create branches of cities that have roads connecting each city within the group to a hospital. If a city cannot have a road connected to a new city, then that city needs to start a new group of cities. This process needs to be repeated until every city is connected to a hospital. |

I read through all of the test case code to understand how the problem works and to see some of test cases. In addition, I wrote code for the instance where hospitals costs less than highways, and if so just build a hospital in every city. |

First, I began by drawing cities randomly and having random gaps between them (like a body of water). In all of my examples the cost of a hospital was always more than the cost of a highway, as I have the situation where the hospitals are cheaper already covered in my code. |
| Sept 14th |  8:45pm - 9:30pm  | Secondly, I connected them in the most efficient way and confirmed that the idea of having groups of cities that had one hospital and roads connecting all of the cities with the group to a hospital would be the cheapest. I then started thinking about this from a computer science angle (ie like how I would code this using the information I just learned and have been given over the past few weeks via the lectures in class). I think that using maps would be helpful to see if cities are connecting (or one's around it are connecting to get the least amount of hospitals). |

In addition, he went over path compression and weight balancing - it finally clicked for me! For weight balancing, the value at the end of some of the nodes are how many other nodes they are connected to. |
